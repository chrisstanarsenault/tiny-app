# Tiny-App Project

This is my first fullstack app called Tiny-App, a URL shortener, much like the idea of sites such as Bit.ly, Deck.ly, etc.  Just a much simplier, uglier version of it :)

## Dependencies - what you need to run this!

- Node.js
- Express
- EJS
- Cookie-Session
- Body-parser
- Bcrypt

## What you'll need to do to get up and running!

- Use 'npm install' to install all the dependancies listed above
- Spin up that server by running 'node express_server.js"
- Use the browser of your choice, and go to 'localhost:8080'
- And lastly, and most important: Have fun!
